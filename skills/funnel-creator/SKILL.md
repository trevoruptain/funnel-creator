# Ad Creative Pipeline Skill

This skill helps Originators create Meta (Facebook/Instagram) ad concepts from product descriptions. It handles project intake, infers audience targeting, generates ad creative concepts, creates images with Gemini 3 Pro, and persists everything to the database via MCP tools.

## What This Skill Does

Takes a product idea and generates ready-to-use ad creatives including:
- Audience targeting recommendations
- Brand tone and messaging strategy
- 3-5 distinct ad concepts with headlines, body copy, and CTAs
- AI-generated images for each concept (via Gemini 3 Pro)
- Everything stored in the database and images on Vercel Blob

## Prerequisites

The `funnel-creator` MCP server must be configured. It provides the following tools:
- `create_project` — persist project + intake data
- `add_ad_concepts` — batch insert ad concepts
- `generate_ad_image` — generate image with Gemini and upload to Vercel Blob
- `get_project` / `list_projects` — retrieve project data

## How to Use

Run `/funnel-creator` to start a new ad project.

## Instructions for Claude

When this skill is invoked, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Project Intake

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to gather intake information. For each question below, call the tool with the appropriate parameters. Present questions ONE AT A TIME, waiting for the user's response before proceeding.

**Q1: What are you selling?**
```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    header: "What are you selling?",
    options: [] // Free text - no predefined options
  }]
})
```

**Q2: Who is it for?**
```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    header: "Who is it for? Describe your target customer.",
    options: [] // Free text
  }]
})
```

**Q3: What should people do after seeing the ad?**
```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    header: "What should people do after seeing the ad?",
    options: [
      { label: "Sign up / join waitlist", value: "signup" },
      { label: "Visit website", value: "visit" },
      { label: "Buy now", value: "buy" },
      { label: "Download app", value: "download" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

**Q4: Link to send people to?**
```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    header: "What's the URL where you want to send people? (Or say 'none yet')",
    options: [] // Free text
  }]
})
```

**Q5: Do you have a logo?**
```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    header: "Do you have a logo?",
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (I'll provide the file path)", value: "yes" },
      { label: "No", value: "no" }
    ]
  }]
})
```
*If yes, ask for file path in next message*

**Q6: Do you have brand colors?**
```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    header: "Do you have brand colors?",
    options: [
      { label: "Yes (I'll provide hex codes or description)", value: "yes" },
      { label: "No (generate a palette for me)", value: "no" }
    ]
  }]
})
```
*If yes, ask for colors in next message*

**Q7: Any reference images or ads you like?**
```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    header: "Any reference images or ads whose style you like? (Optional - URLs, descriptions, or say 'skip')",
    options: [] // Free text
  }]
})
```

**Q8: Monthly ad budget?**
```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    header: "What's your monthly ad budget?",
    options: [
      { label: "Under $500 (testing)", value: "under-500" },
      { label: "$500–$2,000", value: "500-2000" },
      { label: "$2,000–$10,000", value: "2000-10000" },
      { label: "$10,000+", value: "10000+" },
      { label: "Not sure", value: "not-sure" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

**Q9: Where to run ads?**
```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    header: "Where should these ads run?",
    options: [
      { label: "Instagram only", value: "instagram" },
      { label: "Facebook only", value: "facebook" },
      { label: "Both — let Meta optimize", value: "both" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

**Q10: US only or international?**
```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    header: "Geographic targeting?",
    options: [
      { label: "US only", value: "us-only" },
      { label: "Expand internationally", value: "international" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

### Step 2: Analyze and Infer

Based on the intake responses (especially Q1 and Q2), analyze and determine:

**Audience Profile:**
- Demographics (age range, gender, life stage)
- Psychographics (values, concerns, motivations)
- Pain points the product addresses
- Aspirations the product enables

**Targeting Strategy:**
- Meta interest categories to target
- Behavioral signals
- Lookalike audience suggestions
- Placement recommendations (Feed, Stories, Reels)

**Brand Tone:**
- Voice characteristics (professional, friendly, empowering, etc.)
- Messaging approach (educational, emotional, aspirational, practical)
- Language style (technical vs. accessible, formal vs. casual)

Present this analysis to the Originator for confirmation. Allow them to adjust or override any inferences.

### Step 3: Generate Ad Concepts

Create 3-5 distinct ad concepts, each with a different angle or hook. For each concept, provide:

**Concept [Number]: [Angle Name]**

**Angle:** *(What's the unique approach? Problem-focused? Benefit-focused? Social proof? Lifestyle? Urgency?)*

**Headline:** *(5-10 words, attention-grabbing)*

**Body Copy:** *(2-4 sentences, max 125 characters for optimal mobile display)*

**CTA:** *(Clear action, matches Q3 response — e.g., "Join Waitlist", "Learn More", "Shop Now")*

**Visual Direction:** *(Brief description of what the image should show)*

**Image Prompt:** *(Detailed, specific prompt for Gemini image generation. Include: subject, composition, camera angle, lighting, color palette, mood, style (photorealistic/lifestyle/studio), and text overlays if any. Be very specific.)*

**Why This Works:** *(1-2 sentences explaining the psychological hook or marketing principle)*

### Example Output:

```
## Concept 1: Peace of Mind Between Visits

**Angle:** Problem-focused — addresses anxiety gap between doctor appointments

**Headline:** "Know Your Baby's Okay. Every Single Day."

**Body Copy:** Between appointments, worry fills the gaps. Aurora gives you real-time health insights right from your mirror — no extra devices, no guesswork.

**CTA:** Join the Waitlist

**Visual Direction:** Expectant mother looking at her reflection with calm health metrics displayed.

**Image Prompt:** A pregnant woman in her late 20s standing in front of a modern bathroom mirror, soft morning light streaming in from the left. The mirror displays minimal, elegant health metrics in a soft blue-green UI overlay — heart rate, baby movement indicator. She is smiling gently, wearing a comfortable white top. The bathroom is modern and bright with marble countertop. Photorealistic style, warm and reassuring mood. Shallow depth of field focused on her face and the mirror. Aspect ratio 1:1.

**Why This Works:** Speaks directly to the emotional pain point (worry during pregnancy) and positions the product as the solution.
```

### Step 4: Iteration

After presenting the concepts, ask:
- "Which concept resonates most?"
- "Should I adjust tone, angle, or messaging for any of these?"
- "Would you like me to generate additional concepts with different approaches?"

Allow the Originator to revise, combine, or request more concepts.

### Step 5: Save to Database

Once the Originator is satisfied with the concepts:

**5a.** Call `create_project` with:
- `name`: Project name
- `product_description`: Q1 answer
- `target_audience`: Q2 answer
- `intake`: All 10 answers as an object
- `inferred`: The audience profile, targeting strategy, and brand tone from Step 2

**5b.** Call `add_ad_concepts` with the `project_id` from 5a and all approved concepts. Each concept should include the `image_prompt` field.

**5c.** For each concept, generate, review, and approve:
  1. Call `generate_ad_design` with the `ad_concept_id` from 5b
     - This generates structured design JSON including colors, typography, layout, and text overlays
     - Returns an `image_id` for the next step
  2. Call `generate_ad_image` with the returned `image_id`
     - This generates the actual 9:16 image using the design specification
     - Returns the Vercel Blob URL
  3. **Present image to Originator for review:**
     - Display the blob URL as a clickable link
     - Show design JSON preview (colors, visual style, mood, text overlays)
     - Ask: **"Approve this creative? Options: approve / refine / skip"**
  4. Based on response:
     - **approve**: Move to next concept
     - **refine**: Ask for feedback (e.g., "make it warmer", "more professional") → proceed to Step 6
     - **skip**: Move to next concept without saving

**5d.** Call `get_project` to confirm everything was saved, and present the final project summary with image URLs to the Originator.

### Step 6: Refinement (Optional)

If the Originator wants to refine a creative:

**6a.** Call `refine_ad_design` with:
- `image_id`: The ID of the image to refine
- `feedback`: Natural language feedback (e.g., "make it warmer", "more vibrant colors", "more professional tone")

**6b.** Call `regenerate_ad_image` with the same `image_id`
- This regenerates the image using the refined design JSON
- Returns new blob URL

**6c.** Present the regenerated image and ask for approval again

**6d.** Repeat refinement cycle as needed until approved

### Step 7: Meta Campaign Launch Guidance

Once all creatives are approved, provide the Originator with a comprehensive guide for launching their Meta ad campaign. Present this as a structured checklist covering ALL required fields:

---

**📌 RECOMMENDED LAUNCH STRATEGY**

Based on your budget (Q8: **[insert their answer]**) and objective (Q3: **[insert their answer]**):

1. **Week 1:** Run all concepts simultaneously with $10-20/day each
2. **Week 2:** Double down on top 2 performers, pause underperformers
3. **Week 3:** Scale winners by 20-50%, test new audiences
4. **Ongoing:** Refresh creatives every 2-3 weeks to avoid ad fatigue

---

**🎯 YOUR SPECIFIC SETUP** *(Pre-filled based on intake)*

- **Objective:** [Auto-fill based on Q3]
- **Placement:** [Auto-fill based on Q9]
- **Location:** [Auto-fill based on Q10]
- **Destination URL:** [Auto-fill from Q4]
- **Recommended CTA:** [Auto-suggest based on objective]
- **Targeting Interests:** [List from Step 2 analysis]

**Would you like me to create a tracking spreadsheet to monitor performance across all concepts?**

### Step 8: Next Steps

Inform the Originator:
- Their project has been saved to the database
- Images are stored on Vercel Blob and accessible via the blob URLs
- They can retrieve their project anytime via the `get_project` or `list_projects` MCP tools
- The data team can access project data via the `/api/data/projects` endpoint

---

## Key Principles

1. **Infer intelligently** — Don't ask what you can deduce from Q1 and Q2
2. **Show your reasoning** — Explain why you inferred certain audience traits
3. **Diversity of concepts** — Each concept should explore a different psychological trigger
4. **Mobile-first copy** — Keep body text concise and scannable
5. **Specific image prompts** — Be extremely detailed in prompts for Gemini; vague prompts produce generic images
6. **Match the voice** — Tone should align with both the product and the target audience

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Generic headlines that could apply to any product
- Body copy that just repeats the headline
- Mismatched tone (e.g., casual language for serious medical products)
- All concepts using the same angle
- CTAs that don't match the stated objective (Q3)
- Vague image prompts (e.g., "a woman using the product" — instead specify lighting, angle, setting, colors)

---

## Success Criteria

At the end of this skill execution, the Originator should have:
1. Clear understanding of their target audience
2. 3-5 distinct ad concepts ready for creative execution
3. AI-generated images for each concept stored on Vercel Blob
4. Everything persisted in the database for retrieval
5. Next steps clearly communicated
